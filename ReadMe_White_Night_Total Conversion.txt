This is the total conversion modifiaction for Amnesia: The Dark Descent,
White Night.

==============================
HOW TO INSTALL
==============================
Here's a simple tutorial for installing White Night on every system:
http://goo.gl/e213O

For offline instuctions:
Extract everything inside white_night folder to the root folder of Amnesia: The Dark Descent

For Steam Users, by default:
"C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\amnesia the dark descent\"

For direct download or retail users, by default:
"C:\Program Files\Amnesia - The Dark Descent\redist"

Make sure 'White_Night.bat' and 'Amnesia.exe' is in same place. If not,
then your extraction was wrong. Also, there should be new folders added to
your root list, like wn_models etc.

It will ask you to merge the folders. Do not worry, I made White Night in a
way that will not require for you to overwrite any file. If it asks for
anything to overwrite, you should not. A fresh installation of Amnesia would
be much better as this is a 450MB of total conversion.

You can run the game via clicking on White_Night.bat on Windows

==============================
REQUIREMENTS
==============================
- Amnesia: The Dark Descent 1.2 patch (Justine) is essential. Whithout it, you won't be able to play White Night.
