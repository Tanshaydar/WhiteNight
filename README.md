# White Night
White Night is an award winning total conversion mod for Amnesia: The Dark Descent. 
It was originally released in late 2011.

It was originally a total conversion mod, but wasn't fully isolated, which made it hard to install and uninstall, and not friendly towards other mods and custom stories.
Furthermore, updates to Amnesia: The Dark Descent (v1.3 as of now) broke its functionality.
Now it is fully isolated total (IFC) conversion mod and works with latest Amnesia: The Dark Descent (v1.3 as of now).
